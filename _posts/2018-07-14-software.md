Here lists new featues and bug fixes.

**Features:**

* 2019-09-05 Add help page for the DIC and BPIC function.
* 2019-09-05 Expand DIC and BPIC functions to handle model object with many 
subjects.
* 2019-09-22 Add 2-D diffusion model, CDDM.cpp and CDDM.hpp.
* 2019-09-29 Modified lba_ in Likelihood.hpp and rlba_norm in random.R to adapt 
for PM model. Adapted two bessel-function routines, gsl_sf_bessel_zero_J0 & 
gsl_sf_bessel_J1 from GSL for the zero-drift process. 
* 2019-10-14 Add model selection modules. 
* 2019-11-07 Add FCalculation_new. This adds a faster version of distribution 
function of the diffusion decision model when high precision is needed 
(precision > 4) 
* 2019-11-15 Upgrade informal S3 class to formal S4 class
* 2019-11-22 vectorized rlba_norm to accommodate PM model
* 2020-06-01 remove test_dbvnorm and #include <gsl/gsl_randist.h>

 

**Fixes:**

* 2019-09-22 Fix run_many and rerun_many in sampling.R to cope with the change 
in mclapply. Now the ncore option enters mclapply via 
getOption("mc.cores", ncore)). 
* 2019-10-13 Fix deviance.model dimension error, in 'apply' function from across 
column to across row
* 2019-11-26 Temporarily remove FCalculation_new.cpp and class CDF in 
FCalculator.hpp to accommodate that Windows, because it does not have GSL 
library (ie gsl_integration.h).
* 2019-11-28 Fixed simulate_one in model-class.R when trial numbers are 0 for 
some design cell.
